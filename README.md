# MATLAB dDPI Implementation
The `ddpi_offline` function is implementation of the dDPI algorithm in MATLAB. It takes in a video of the eye that has the first and fourth Purkinje images visible and outputs the DPI trace. See the comments in the MATLAB file for more information.

The function can be run as is from within the same directory structure with the following command: 

`ddpi_offline('videos/fixation_example.avi')`

This processes the sample fixation video provided in the `videos` folder.
